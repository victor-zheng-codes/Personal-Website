      <description>Here is the biography of me for the University of Toronto Tennis Club for 2023-2024.
Victor Zheng has served as the UofT Tennis Club’s Head of Courts (21-22), Vice President (22-23), and President (23-present).
Growing up, he was a badminton player. He never took up tennis until the age of 11, when he joined his brother at the UBC’s High-Performance Junior Tennis Training program, then coached by BC Champion Daniel Chu.</description>

      <description>On October 24, 2022, I organized the Fall 2022 Skule Tennis Club (STC) vs UofT Tennis Club (UTTC) match, which resulted in a resounding victory for UTTC 11-5. Going in to the match, I had worked with Sara, STC&amp;rsquo;s President to make sure that we had everything ready to go and people to play against. I also worked with Sir Winston Churchill Park Tennis Club by booking the courts for a very low cost of $10 per member for 4 hours from 3pm-7pm.</description>
