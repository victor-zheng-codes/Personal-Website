[{"content":"About Me I\u0026rsquo;m currently a undergraduate at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia and moved to Toronto for school. I love working on interesting projects which have a meaningful impact on the lives of others. Some of my highlight volunteer work include being the Chief Organizer of the 2024 Canadian National Chess Championships also-known-as Zonals (the most important Canadian chess event of 2024), a 354 student hackathon at the International Science and Engineering Fair, and a 60-player tennis tournament (the largest at U of T). The two main leadership positions I\u0026rsquo;ve held over my undergraduate career are as the President of the UofT Tennis Club, and the Hart House Chess Club.\nAt U of T, I\u0026rsquo;ve conducted my internship year at the Ministry of Education of Ontario and TD Bank. At these two places, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about the entire software development lifecycle: the planning, developing, building, deploying, testing, and operating of the applications that run the world.\nI believe that we can build bridges to make the world a better place.\nCoding Portfolio To view the most up to date projects that I am working on, please visit my GitHub page, victor-zheng-codes.\nBlogs On this site victorzheng.ca you can find my recaps and news regarding cool projects which I have worked on over the years. I hope that by writing, I can inspire others to follow in my footsteps and make the world an even better place to be.\nContact Please contact me via my LinkedIn or consider dropping me an email at hello@victorzheng.ca\n","permalink":"https://victorzheng.ca/about/","summary":"about","title":"About"}]
