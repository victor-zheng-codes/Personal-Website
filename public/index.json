[{"content":"About Me Born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, has allowed me to experience the potential of our world today. I\u0026rsquo;ve focused my undergrad years more on the impact that I can create for those around me. I love joining projects and making things happen. Thus, I\u0026rsquo;ve been part of events with the likes of Grandmaster Garry Kasparov, conducted a 212 person chess tournament, hosted a 253 virtual hackathon, a 354 person student mini-hackathon at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), a 54-person tennis tournament, and numerous smaller events. Leadership positions as the president of the UofT Tennis Club, where I manage over 130 paid members and around 600 audience members.\nPortfolio To view the most up to date projects that I am working on, please visit my GitHub page, victor-zheng-codes.
