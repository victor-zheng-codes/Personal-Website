## About Me

Born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, has allowed me to experience the potential of our world today. I've focused my undergrad years more on the impact that I can create for those around me. I love joining projects and making things happen. Thus, I've been part of events with the likes of Grandmaster Garry Kasparov, conducted a 212 person chess tournament, hosted a 253 virtual hackathon, a 354 person student mini-hackathon at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), a 54-person tennis tournament, and numerous smaller events. Leadership positions as the president of the UofT Tennis Club, where I manage over 130 paid members and around 600 audience members.
