## About Me

I'm currently a undergraduate at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia and moved to Toronto for school. I love working on interesting projects which have a meaningful impact on the lives of others. Some of my highlight volunteer work include being the Chief Organizer of the 2024 Canadian National Chess Championships also-known-as Zonals (the most important Canadian chess event of 2024), a 354 student hackathon at the International Science and Engineering Fair, and a 60-player tennis tournament (the largest at U of T). The two main leadership positions I've held over my undergraduate career are as the President of the UofT Tennis Club, and the Hart House Chess Club. 

At U of T, I've conducted my internship year at the Ministry of Education of Ontario and TD Bank. At these two places, I've learned about the entire software development lifecycle: the planning, developing, building, deploying, testing, and operating of the applications that run the world. 

I believe that we can build bridges to make the world a better place.
