## Photo Archive
- I currently store my favourite photos from the past few years here!

## Canadian Hackathon List
- Hackathons are a passion of mine. I don't know why, but Canada doesn't have a great list of all the hackathons that happen in Canada. I'm on a mission to bring hackathon awareness to others. 

## School/Course Work Display
- This website will display cool course work that I've worked on over the years
- I will also list out the courses I've taken and some thoughts on how I found them. 

## Robotics
- I've accumulated a lot of robotics experience and would like to share it with the world. It'

## Personal Blog
- I hope to post some updates about the recent successes (and failures) that I've experienced throughout the days and months of my undergrad. I've realized the potential that blogging has, and the memories that can be kept and maintained. 
- It's also a good way of showcasing the cool events and projects that I've been a part of. 

## Task Tracker 
- I hope to design a task tracker and pomodoro timer that takes the least amount of computational power. I just want it to be simple, have the tasks I want, and have a timer that is very clear and visible with a sound when it is over. 
- It'd be very cool to have that available on my personal website

## Chess
- There are various projects that I've been working / have worked on over the years related to chess. I think it'd be cool to document them 

## Tennis
- I've coached tennis players, played competitive tennis, and have led the UofT Tennis Club as it's President and I have some plans on what I'd like to add to the Club. There are some data visualization and data analysis projects that I think could benefit our members.
- I think I can leverage data visualization projects to support more beginners and attract more beginners at UofT to play tennis. 
- I have also conducted tennis stringing and trained at UBC's Junior Tennis Programs. 

## XdHacks Mini
- I joined XdHacks Mini in June 2020 as the Activities Director at XdHacks Mini Vancouver, and now am the Chief Round Coordinator at the NPO hackathon organization. I think there's a lot that I can showcase on this website, and a lot that I can still do to improve the organization and help the world combine soft and technical skills together. 

## Graphics Design
- As the Communications Director and designer of numerous projects, there are lots of powerpoints and designs that I've created to showcase various brands.
- I have experience using Inkscape, Gimp, Microsoft Photos, ShotCut, Canva, and other image processing softwares. 

## 3D Printing
- 3D printing is one of my side hobbies, and something that I want to eventually add to this page. 

## Emails
- As boring as this sounds, I think it'd be cool to have a webpage/site designed to display the emails I've sent over the years and the progress in business communication that I've learned.
